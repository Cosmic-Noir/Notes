Downside to native development - Have to build for android and iOS. Twice the work and cost. 

PWA - Progressive web apps. Downside is you're not in the appstore, limited access to platform capabilities, but this is changing. 

Capacitor/Cordova - Use web tech, single codebase, access to platform. Non-native UI/performance. 

Cordova is "Phone Gap" - Cordova is the open source project. 
  - Configure with config.xml - Where you have Android and iOS specifications. 
  - Generates an iOS/Android project every time you build. Run the command, uses the config file to create the project. 
  - Lots of community support.
  - Does use some old version of Apple APIs - legacy issues. Such as camera API. 


Capacitor 
  - Developed by Ionic. Decided that it was really hard to push Cordova where it needed to be. They decided to do things differently and better.
  - Configure with capacitor.config.json file.
